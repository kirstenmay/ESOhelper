# ESOhelper

ESO helper is a mock up of the actual ESO application that is used when fire and EMS is dispatched to an emergency/incident.

The goal of this project is to add a feature that persists data throughout the forms so that the first responders can make accurate subjective narratives without needing to switch to previous form tabs to get vitals and other patient information.

This is an open source project built with JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Angular.
